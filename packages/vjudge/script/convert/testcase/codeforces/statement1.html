            <p>You are given a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$$$.</p>
            <p>
                You would like to partition $$$a$$$ into several <span class="tex-font-style-bf">subsequences</span>$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ $$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k$$$,
                satisfying the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each element in $$$a$$$ belongs to exactly one of $$$b_i$$$.</li>
                <li>
                    For each sequence $$$b_i$$$, let its elements be $$$b_{i,1},b_{i,2},\ldots,b_{i,p_i}$$$. For every $$$1\le j&lt;p_i$$$, $$$|b_{i,j}-b_{i,j+1}|=1$$$
                    should hold.

                    $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$b_i$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$a$$$ if $$$b_i$$$ can be obtained from $$$a$$$ by the deletion of several
